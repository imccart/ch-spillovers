All analysis was performed through a secure remote desktop using R. Below, we separate our files into functions and other code files. The functions are stand-along and called by different individual code files. All files are called by the [Main Analysis](analysis/_main.R) file.

## Functions

1. [Discrete Choice](analysis/fn_logit_model.R).

2. [Bootstrap Standard Errors](analysis/fn_choice_reg_bs.R).


## Analysis Files

1. [Summary Statistics](analysis/summary_stats.R).

2. [Discrete Choice](analysis/choice_reg_year.R).

    a. [Inpatient Choice Data](analysis/choice_reg_ip.R).
    
    b. [Outpatient Choice Data](analysis/choice_reg_op.R).
    
3. [Differentiation](analysis/differentiation.R).
