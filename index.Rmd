Welcome! This is a small site designed to house materials for our project examining the role of specialization in health care, specifically with regard to Children's Hospitals. Use the top menu to navigate the site, and you can find all of the source code at the GitHub repository, [here](https://github.com/imccart/ch-spillovers).
